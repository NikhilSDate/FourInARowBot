# Four in a Row Bot

This project is a Discord bot that lets Discord users play the popular two-player game 
Four in a Row (called Connect Four by Hasbro) against each other. 

## Features


* The bot supports multiple simultaneous games across different servers and channels. However, 
only one game can be played at a time in a single channel.
* The standard Four in a Row board has 6 rows and 7 columns. Games are won by achieving 4 pieces in a row. The bot 
  supports games with custom board sizes (users can specify the number of rows and columns they want when creating  a new game).
  Users can also specify a custom number of pieces in a row to win the game.
* By default, colors are randomly assigned to the players in a game, but the bot also allows the player 
  initiating the game to chose their color.
* A player can resign a game at any time. This will end the game and give the win to the other player.
